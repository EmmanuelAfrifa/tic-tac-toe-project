## Project Description
- The webpage is responsive and this was achieved by the use of media queries and flex box.
- The user has the option to play against a CPU opponent or agains another human player.
- Before the game board is displayed, a user must first select his/her marker.
- I used the minimax algorithm to make the CPU's move and it makes it almost impossible to beat the CPU.
- When the game ends, the appropriate message is displayed
- When there is a win, depending on who wins, the winning combo gets a unique styling.
- At the end of the game, a user is presented with the option to either quit the game or proceed to the next round.
- Also, there is a restart button at the top right corner of the game board on which a user can click and he/she will be given the option to either restart the current round of the game or cancel the request.
